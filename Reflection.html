<h1>Digital Literacy Narrative</h1>
 <p>Throughout the semester, I can say will all confidence that my Digital Literacy has increased. When reflecting on the Digital Literacy site I made at the beggining of the semester, it was rewarding seeing my comments then and now seeing the progress I've made. At the beggining of the semester, in all honesty, I was very nervous for class. After reading over the sylabus, I knew I was about to gain exposure to material I had no background or experience with. I had found my comfort zone using templated website generators, as well as Google Drive and all its applications. After everything I've learned in the class, I feel as though I've expanded my Digital Literacy to levels I didn't think I would ever reach. Learning HTML, CSS, Markdown, Github, Oxygen, and more materials from class would have been applications I'd of never worked with if it weren't for this class. At the end of this class, I can say that in the future, I would be comfortable using all of the applications I listed. I'm even using Github to make a site for another class. Although this class has made me face many challenges and forced me to get out of my comfort zone, it was worth the struggle. Even more so, reflecting and the Personal Learning Card I made at the beggining of the semester and seeing all of the new branches I've made this semester has been rewarding. I will most definitely takeaway and use all the materials I've learned in class and apply them in any future career I may have to help succeed.</p>
