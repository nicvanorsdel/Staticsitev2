<h1>Digital Literacy Narrative</h1>

<p>Over the course of this semester, I have really improved my literacy with digital writing technologies. Before this course started, I was unsure how well I would catch on to working with various markup languages, and felt pretty overwhelmed looking at what kind of work was going to be expected out of us; especially in a remote setting. Fast forward to now, I have been pleasantly surprised as to how well I have been able to follow along with course material, and feel pretty confident working with all the tools we have been introduced to. Going forward I plan on using this website I've built as a working portfolio for my career. I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish, but still plan on improving it by adding additional elements and features that make the platform easier to engage with and look at. Overall, I have learned a lot this semester, and built some foundations that will help me in both my studies and career moving forward.</p>
