<h1>Writing With Digital Technologies in Class Assignements</h1>

  <p>Throughout this semester, I had the change to work on many different projects that exposed me to relatively new experiences. Before this class, I had no experience with coding or constructing my own website from scratch. Look at me now!</p>
<p>Not only did the semster expose me to languages from HTML, CSS, and Markdown, but it provided me with the chance to work with them hands on. In terms of displaying my learnring and journey during the semester, two different projects in class come to mind that display everything I've learned. These two projects are a client project that myself and a group of classmates worked on, as well as a Markdown reflection I created in regards to usability. Both projects display two different takeaways from the class that can show the progress I've made.</p>
 <p>Begginning with the client project, I was assigned a group of three class members and instructed to create a website design for the MN Austin Healey Club. Before the project, their website wasn't very user friendly and had a relatively poor design. After meeting multiple times with my group members, we were able to not only write up a report on the changes we believed were best, but also created a mock website. If you click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfQiWSNWc_6r5I89L-SAXXp32iApUiGEwBHUC-aeKV8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> you can see the report we created. Also, in the report, there is a link to the website itself we created.</p>  
  <p>The second project that shows my progress is the Markdown doucment I created for a usability reflection. For my reflection, I focused on the usability of Google Docs. I felt that is was a great refresher on how to use key aspects of Google Docs, as well as an education on headings sizes and text sizes when creating a technical document in Google Docs. My instructor was kind enough to create a GitHub page of all the class reflections, and if you would like to read my reflection more in-depth, you may click <a href=https://danieljcard1.github.io/lavadocs/4662/vanorsdel/">here</a> to view the reflection.</p>
  <p>Both of the examples I've shared can display things that I've learned this semester. In addition, this site itself shows my learning as well. Using and learning GitHub was also a point of learning in the semester. Overall, I learned many useful skills this semester, and will continue to devlop the skills I've learned in the future.</p>
