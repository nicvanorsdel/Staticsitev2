<h1>Writing With Digital Technologies in Class Assignements</h1>

  <p>Throughout this semester, I had the change to work on many different projects that exposed me to relatively new experiences. Before this class, I had no experience with coding or constructing my own website from scratch. Look at me now!</p>
<p>Not only did the semster expose me to languages from HTML, CSS, and Markdown, but it provided me with the chance to work with them hands on. In terms of displaying my learnring and journey during the semester, two different projects in class come to mind that display everything I've learned. These two projects are a client project that myself and a group of classmates worked on, as well as a Markdown reflection I created in regards to usability. Both projects display two different takeaways from the class that can show the progress I've made.</p>
